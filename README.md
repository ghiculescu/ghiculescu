### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm CTO at [@TandaHQ](https://github.com/TandaHQ). We eliminiate employment friction for hourly workforces, with the goal of decreasing the global unemployment rate. I started the company in 2012. We've never taken venture capital and have no plans to ever exit. We have offices in Brisbane (my hometown!), Chicago (my current home!), and London (rains a lot!).

I'm on the [@rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) triage team, a top 100 [Rails contributor](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/), and do seed investments in companies built on Rails. I think Rails is a pretty good framework!

You can reach me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghiculescu/) or by emailing `alex@workforce.com`. Don't apologise for reaching out! I'm particularly keen to hear from you if you're interested in joining our team, or have a new Rails project I might be able to help with.
